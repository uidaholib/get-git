# Prep and Installation 

To join the wonderful world of version control, please create a GitHub account and install Git on your system.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a Git repository hosting service, a place to store and sync your work in the cloud. 
Take a minute to create a [free account](https://github.com/join).
They provide some great introductory [tutorials](https://guides.github.com/), but you can probably ignore them if you are coming to the workshop!

## Install Git

- Windows: install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) using the default options. This will give you Git, Git Bash, and Git GUI. Git Bash is a great terminal that lets you use UNIX style commands on Windows.
- Mac: check if Git is already installed by opening terminal and typing `git --version`. If you do not have it, download the official [Mac installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Linux: install from your distribution's software center or package manager (for Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install git`).

## GitHub Desktop

If you are interested in using a visual GUI application integrated with GitHub, Windows and Mac users should also install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) using the default options.
You can install GitHub Desktop in addition to other versions of Git.

There are other [GUI apps available](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) for managing and visualizing Git repositories, including Linux options.
