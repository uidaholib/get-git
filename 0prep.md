# Prep and Setup 

To follow along at the workshop, please create a Github account and install Git on your system (see instructions below). If you don't have time to get set up, don't worry--you will still get a good introduction to the wonderful world of version control. Hopefully you won't need file names like these anymore: http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531   

Set up instructions:
 
Sign up for Github is free and easy. Create a free account: https://github.com/ . You can ignore their introductory tutorials for now, because you are coming to the workshop!

For Windows install "Git for Windows", using the default options, https://git-scm.com/downloads , which will give you Git, Git Bash, and Git GUI. Git Bash is a great terminal emulator that lets you use UNIX style commands on Windows.
For Mac users, your system might already have Git installed. Open terminal and type "git --version". If you do not have it, it will prompt you to install. Download the Mac installer from, https://git-scm.com/downloads   
For Linux users, install Git using your package management (such as "sudo apt-get install git") or software center.

If you are interested in using a visual GUI application integrated with Github, Windows and Mac users should also install "Github Desktop" using the default options, https://desktop.github.com/ . You can install Github Desktop even if you have another version of Git already installed.
For Linux there are a few other GUI apps available, check https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux
